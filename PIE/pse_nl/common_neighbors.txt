The pseudo-code you've provided outlines a function called 'find_common_neighbors' that is designed to find common neighbors between two nodes in a graph. Here's a natural language explanation of its core idea:
1. Function Definition: The function 'find_common_neighbors' is defined to take three parameters: 'graph', 'node1', and 'node2'. The 'graph' is the data structure that represents the network of nodes and their connections, while 'node1' and 'node2' are the two specific nodes for which we want to find common neighbors.
2. Initialization: An empty list called 'common_neighbors' is created. This list will store the nodes that are common to both 'node1' and 'node2'.
3. Iteration: The function then iterates over all the nodes in the 'graph'. For each node in the graph, it checks whether this node is a neighbor of both 'node1' and 'node2'.
4. Condition Check: For each node, the function checks if the node is present in the list of neighbors of both 'node1' and 'node2'. If a node is a neighbor of both, it means that 'node1' and 'node2' share this node as a common neighbor.
5. Addition to List: If the condition is true (i.e., the node is a common neighbor), the node is added to the 'common_neighbors' list.
6. Return: After the iteration is complete, the function returns the 'common_neighbors' list, which now contains all the nodes that are common neighbors of 'node1' and 'node2'.
In summary, the core idea of this pseudo-code is to identify and return a list of nodes that are connected to two specified nodes within a graph, highlighting the shared connections or "common neighbors" between them. This can be useful in various graph analysis tasks, such as social network analysis, where understanding the relationships between different individuals or groups is important.
