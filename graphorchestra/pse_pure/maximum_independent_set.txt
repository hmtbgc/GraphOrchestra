Function find maximum independent set of graph G : a maximum independent set S
  All nodes are re-ordered from smallest to largest by degree.
  IS ← ∅;
  for v ∈ V of G do
    State[v] ← 0; 
  for v ∈ V of G do
    if State[v]=0 then
      IS ← IS ∪ {v};
      for each u in N(v) do
        if State[u]=0 then
          State[u] ← 1;
  return length of IS.
