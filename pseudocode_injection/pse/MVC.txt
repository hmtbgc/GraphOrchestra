Function find Minimum Vertex Cover of graph G:
    vertex_cover ← empty set
    edges ← empty set

    for each vertex and its neighbors in G:
        for each neighbor:
            if (vertex, neighbor) is not in edges and (neighbor, vertex) is not in edges:
                add (vertex, neighbor) to edges

    while edges is not empty:
        max_coverage = -1
        best_vertex = None
        for each vertex and its neighbors in G:
            covered_edges = {edge | edge in edges and vertex in edge}
            coverage = size of covered_edges
            if coverage > max_coverage:
                max_coverage = coverage
                best_vertex = vertex

        add best_vertex to vertex_cover
        edges = edges - {edge | edge in edges and best_vertex in edge}
